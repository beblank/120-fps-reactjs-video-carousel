# 120 FPS ReactJS Video Carousel

A high-performance React.js video carousel application designed to showcase ultra-smooth 120 FPS video playback with real-time performance monitoring.

## Features

âœ¨ **High-Performance Rendering**: Optimized for 120 FPS display with smooth animations
ðŸŽ¥ **Video Carousel**: Navigate through multiple video patterns with intuitive controls
ðŸ“Š **Real-Time FPS Monitoring**: Live display of both render FPS and application FPS
ðŸŽ® **Interactive Controls**: Play/pause and navigation buttons for seamless user experience
ðŸŽ¨ **Multiple Visual Patterns**: Four different animated patterns to demonstrate high FPS capabilities

## Demo Patterns

1. **Animated Gradient** - Smooth color transitions and gradients
2. **Moving Checkerboard** - Dynamic checkerboard pattern with vibrant colors
3. **Wave Pattern** - Mathematical wave-based visual effects
4. **Particle System** - Physics-based particle animation with collision detection

## Technologies Used

- **React 19.1** - Modern React with latest features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS styling solution
- **Canvas API** - High-performance 2D rendering
- **requestAnimationFrame** - Optimized animation loops

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/beblank/120-fps-reactjs-video-carousel.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd 120-fps-reactjs-video-carousel

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The application will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build optimized production bundle
npm run build

# Serve production build locally
npx serve -s build
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ VideoCarousel.tsx    # Main carousel component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FPSMonitor.tsx       # Real-time FPS monitoring
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CanvasVideo.tsx      # High-performance canvas renderer
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts             # Component exports
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx                  # Root application component
â””â”€â”€ index.tsx               # Application entry point
```

## Performance Features

### FPS Monitoring
- **Application FPS**: Measures the overall app performance
- **Render FPS**: Tracks the canvas rendering performance
- **Color-coded indicators**: Green (100+ FPS), Yellow (60+ FPS), Orange (30+ FPS), Red (<30 FPS)

### Optimization Techniques
- Canvas-based rendering for maximum performance
- Optimized animation loops using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Efficient state management to minimize re-renders
- Hardware acceleration through canvas APIs

## Usage

1. **Navigation**: Use the left (â€¹) and right (â€º) arrows to switch between video patterns
2. **Play/Pause**: Click the center button to control playback
3. **FPS Monitoring**: Watch the real-time FPS counters in the top-left corner
4. **Pattern Info**: View current pattern details in the bottom-left corner
